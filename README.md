# Assignment 2: Digital Stopwatch (in ARMlite)

## Due Date
**11:59 PM, Friday, May 26th**

## Overview
In this assignment, you will implement the Digital Stopwatch as specified in Assignment 1, using the ARMlite ARM Assembler. The goal is to replicate the stopwatch functionality in the ARMlite simulator as closely as possible. You will also need to create a video (up to 5 minutes) demonstrating your working solution and explaining its functionality.

## Assessment
This assignment is worth **15%** of your total grade for this unit. Your solution will be graded based on the following criteria:

### 1. Level of Completion (50%)
The grading for this criterion is based on the following stages:

1. **Stopwatch Beginnings (20/50 marks)**
   - Display seconds incrementing in the text output display area.
   - Allow the timer to be paused and un-paused.

2. **Stopwatch Basics (30/50 marks)**
   - Show time ticking in real-time.
   - Offer start/pause and reset functionality.

3. **Stopwatch with Benefits (50/50 marks)**
   - Include functionality to display split times when requested (e.g., when “s” is entered).
   - Continue showing the timer while displaying split times.

4. **Stopwatch with Buffering (Bonus +5%)**
   - Track the last 5 split times during a single timed activity.
   - Display one split time at a time and allow viewing each split time in turn.

5. **Stopwatch of Beauty (Bonus +5%)**
   - Display all digits on the ARMlite display screen.
   - Closely replicate the functional requirements of Stage 7 from Assignment 1.

### 2. Quality of Solution (35%)
   - Assess the layout and readability of your code.
   - Evaluate the use of relevant data structures (e.g., variables, arrays, stack).
   - Review functional decomposition (i.e., use of functions).
   - Ensure adherence to ABI conventions.

### 3. Video Demonstration (15%)
   - Create a video of no more than 5 minutes demonstrating all features of your solution.
   - Include highlighted examples (no more than 2) from your code to showcase key concepts.
   - The program will be tested independently of the video, so it must work as demonstrated.

## Submission
Submit a single zip or 7z file with the following items on Canvas by **11:59 PM, May 26th**:

1. **Project Source File**: Implementing the solution for execution in the ARMlite simulator.
2. **Video File or Document**: With a URL to an online video (include any relevant access details if required).
3. **Written Report**: No more than 5 pages, including:
   - Overview of your solution and design.
   - Clear instructions on how to run and use your program.
   - Any issues or bugs you are aware of (voluntary disclosure of errors may reduce associated penalties).

Ensure all files are correctly named and organized before submission. Good luck with your assignment!
